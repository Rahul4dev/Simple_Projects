# Simple Carousel 

__**Description**__
  - User setInterval to change the images. Images are from [Unsplash]()
  - For the next and prev button, we have to first clear the interval in order to get the correct index per image. Otherwise it will be added or substracted from the image index and affect the slide animation.
  - for slide, I just used transfrom- translateX according to the image width.
  ------------------
  Please tolerate the external svg, these are added because in I'm learning, how to use them in the images and gifs properly.
