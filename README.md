# Account Verification Code Feature:

_**Description: Number code which we get on email or number for the verification of account on login or chaeckout**_

  - Using simple HTML structure and CSS styling we can easily acheve this
  - With JS, we can make input field to take only one number and move to the next code space.
  - With backspace we can change the number pressed wrong, if any,
  - In CSS, we have used deprecated styles like:
  
  ```css
.code::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
.code::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  -moz-appearance: textfield; 
  margin: 0;
}
  
  
  ```
  
  Both -webkit-appearance and -moz-appearance are deprecated now. Do you know any alternative of those?
