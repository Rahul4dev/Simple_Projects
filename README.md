# Pokemon Cards

_*Description*_
  - Using fetch: we have fetched the data from PokeApi
  - From data, we got pokemaon name, type and id or ranking
  - For Type:, we will use higher-order array method, Map() to get the type from nested types array.
  - for the images with respective id, we had to use pokemon.sprites.other.dream_world.front_default for every id call
  - For the card, we create a template of card to pass literally, in JS which get appended with the card-container
  - In code, we have called the fetch function 100 times, which is not heavy for practice purpose.
