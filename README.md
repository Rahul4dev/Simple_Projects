# Netflix Nav-Animation

_*Description*_:
  - Here we are going to replicate the nav-slider of Netflix which opens the new tabs for us to explore.
  - To accomplish this we have used simple HTML, CSS and JS code
  - I have used the Netflix logo from Google
  - Slider animation comes due to TranslateX to -100% to 0 so it pop out when we click on ham icon
  - This transition got some delay inorder to create the soomth transition of multiple colored slider to slide
  - Also, we toggle form active to none in visible property for the mobile menu..
